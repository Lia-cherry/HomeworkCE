1) implement the fire department with the help of concurrence, that is, there are streams that are waiting for the signal, and when the signal arrives, they go to the call. 
Let there be one fire department, and the streams are two brigades. A signal is a call to the operator. 

2) Producer-recipient: one stream sends data, others will receive it and process it.

3) Make 5 streams, each stream must generate songs (each stream is a separate genre) and these songs need to be stored somewhere so that all streams can reach them
